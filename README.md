# EmpowHer
EmpowHer is an innovative mobile application designed to provide a quick and reliable response system for women in distress. This app serves as a powerful tool in combating crimes against women by allowing them to send SOS signals and instantly report incidents to the local police authorities. Leveraging the widespread availability of smartphones and advanced communication technologies, this app aims to empower women to feel safer and enhance their overall personal security. The app's core functionality revolves around the SOS feature, which allows women to send distress signals with their location information to the nearest police station. Upon activation, the app triggers an alert, notifying the police authorities of the user's exact location and providing them with crucial details necessary for immediate response. The app establishes a direct line of communication between the user and the police, ensuring that help is dispatched efficiently and effectively.

# Register Page
This is our Register Page; in this, users can enter their name, mail, phone number, password and their designation, civilian or police. While registering for our app, the user's system id is also registered along with the user's details to check whether the registered user has a unique and validated id or not. Before registering your system's ID and database registered id is also checked to maintain the authenticity of the user for our app. Why we used this method? So, as to check on the pranksters who may give false information to the police. And after this, all checks of the user's details are registered to the Firebase's real-time database.
